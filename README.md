> ### [Ruby-Hyperloop](https://github.com/ruby-hyperloop/hyperloop) codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **[YOUR_FRAMEWORK]** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

NOTE under construction! - Currently this is just the Fork of the Rails RealWorld server.  Next steps:

+ Add Hyperloop Gem
+ Make Models Public
+ Get an Isomorphic Spec running that demonstrates model access on the client
+ Use the React Realworld client as a base, and rewrite components in Ruby
+ Profit!

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **[YOUR_FRAMEWORK]** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.
